  <p>An ELO leaderboard ranks players using an ELO formula and a Wins leaderboard ranks players based on wins.</p></br>
  <p>Why don't I advance above the person I challenged in an ELO leaderboard?</p>
  <p>Leaderboards are based on the ELO rating system, which uses your relative ratings in computing how much your rating increases or decreases after a match.</p></br>
  <p>What is a bracket tournament?</p>
  <p>Bracket tournaments are ones in which you need to win the match to advance to the next round. There are single elimination and double elimination bracket tournaments.
